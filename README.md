# [NMRiH] Team Healing

Allows survivors to share medical supplies and heal each other!

## Installation
- (Optional) Upgrade to Sourcemod 1.11.0.6506 or higher. This will enable some extra features.
- Grab the latest zip from the [releases](https://github.com/dysphie/nmrih-team-healing/releases) section.
- Extract the contents into `addons/sourcemod`
- Refresh the plugin list (`sm plugins refresh` in server console)

## Usage

### Healing 
Equip a first aid kit or bandages and hold USE (Default: `E`) on another player to treat them. 
- Team healing is slightly faster than self healing by default. 
- Players can break out of healing by crouching. 
- There's an exponential cooldown on healing attempts to prevent griefing.
- On Sourcemod 1.11.0.6506 or higher, healing is disabled when zombies are too close. Clients can toggle this protection off in their settings.

### Sharing supplies

Equip a medical supply and use secondary attack (Default: Right-click) on another player to give it to them.
